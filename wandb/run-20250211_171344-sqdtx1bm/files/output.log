Based on these findings, \n              what would cystometry most likely reveal about her residual volume and detrusor contractions?\n\n### Response:\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this medical question here about a 61-year-old woman with a history of involuntary urine loss when she coughs or sneezes, but she doesn't leak at night. She undergoes a gynecological exam and a Q-tip test. The question is asking what cystometry would most likely show regarding her residual volume and detrusor contractions.\n\nFirst, I need to break this down. Let's start with the patient's history. She's experiencing urinary incontinence during activities like coughing or sneezing, which are common triggers for stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Stress incontinence usually happens when the urethral sphincter isn't strong enough to resist pressure from the bladder during these activities. However, she doesn't leak at night, which is more typical of urge urinary incontinence (UUI), where the bladder has a strong, sudden urge to urinate, often leading to nocturnal enuresis.\n\nBut her main issue is the daytime leakage, which points towards SUI rather than UUI. SUI is often due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD), where the sphincter muscles have weakened or are damaged, making it hard to hold urine under pressure.\n\nNow, she undergoes a gynecological exam and a Q-tip test. The Q-tip test is a diagnostic tool used to assess urethral function. It's named after the shape of the catheter used in the test. The procedure involves inserting a Q-tip catheter into the urethra and measuring the pressure at different points along the catheter. If the pressure is higher than normal, it suggests that the sphincter muscles are not relaxing properly, which is a sign of ISD.\n\nSo, based on the gynecological exam and the Q-tip test results, if they find evidence of ISD, that would support the diagnosis of SUI. Now, moving on to the question about cystometry. Cystometry is a diagnostic test where a catheter is placed in the bladder, and the patient is asked to perform activities that might cause a cough or sneeze to see if there's leakage. It's used to assess how the bladder and sphincter respond to these activities.\n\nIn cystometry, the residual volume of the bladder is the amount of urine left in the bladder after a normal void. If the bladder capacity is normal, the residual volume is usually less than 100-200 ml. However, in cases of SUI, especially with ISD, the bladder capacity might be normal, but the sphincter can't prevent leakage during increased abdominal pressure.\n\nDetrusor contractions refer to the involuntary contractions of the detrusor muscle, which is the muscle layer of the bladder. These contractions are normal and help empty the bladder. In UUI, there's an overactive detrusor muscle, leading to strong, frequent contractions. However, in SUI, the issue is not with the detrusor contractions but with the sphincter's ability to resist pressure.\n\nSo, if the Q-tip test shows evidence of ISD and the history points towards SUI, the cystometry would likely show normal detrusor contractions because the problem is not with the bladder muscle but with the sphincter. The residual volume might be normal as well, unless there's some functional obstruction or if the bladder is not emptying properly due to some other issue.\n\nWait, but sometimes
